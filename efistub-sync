#
# Synchronise the EFI Unified Kernel Images on EFI partition with the kernel / commandline / initrd / microcode
# currently installed on the system; intended to be run after any change to these components, in order to remove
# need for additional bootloaders.
#
# When run, generates the EFI Unified Kernel Image, then puts it in target directory (defaults to /boot/efi/EFI)
# for access via boot entry. If the older image is in place, it gets renamed and kept as backup, up to configured
# number of backups (defaults to 3).
#
# Complimentary Pacman hook ensures the automatic synchronisation when the kernel files, microcode, or initcpio
# components are modified during installation/update, but should be run manually for manual updates to initramfs,
# or to preferred command line.
#
# Arguments:
#   all                  If given this argument, synchronises EFI image for every kernel currently installed.
#   <kernel>...          Package name for the kernel to synchronise, such as "linux", "linux-zen", or "linux-tkg";
#                        multiple may be specified.
#
# Options:
#   -h                   Show this message and exit.
#   -V                   Show version and exit.
#
# Additional configuration (target directory for EFI images, source of kernel command line, and how many) can be done
# by modifying the configuration file at /etc/efistub-sync.conf.
